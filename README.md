  1. Please use python2.7 with tkinter installed.

  2. Terminal commands
  	python Project.py("Change the experimentnumber in main() in project.py")

  3. The program saves the Q_values in a csv file
  4. The graphs of Bank account values are saved
  5. The number of operators performance measure is printed to terminal. SInce there can be more than 1 time a terminal can be reached in an experiment, total number of operators required to reach a terminal state is calculated everytime terminal is reached. ALL these are stored in num_operators array ;printed to the terminal
```
Using Q Learning and SARSA learning, we analyze an agentï¿½s performance in a grid world. The given game does not have a goal state. It learns iteratively until the maximum number of steps is reached
* When the agent reaches a pickup block and the agent does not have a block, it will pick.
